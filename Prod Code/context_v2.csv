"For Sorghum/Jowar crop in Riphening stage the advisory is - Stem Borer in Sorghum Crop:
Infestation Period:
Stem borer infests the sorghum crop from the 2nd week until maturity.
Feeding Behavior:
Larvae initially feed on the upper surface of whorl leaves, leaving transparent windows on the lower surface.
Increasing feeding severity results in a blend of punctures and scratches on the leaves.
'Dead heart' symptoms may develop in younger plants due to early attacks.
Larvae subsequently bore into the stem, causing extensive tunneling.
Peduncle tunneling can lead to breakage or partial damage to chaffy panicles.
Cultural Control Measures:
Stubble Management:
The carryover of pests from one season to another occurs through stubbles left in the field and stems used as fodder after harvest.
Cultural control involves uprooting and burning stubbles, as well as chopping stems to prevent pest carryover.
Crop Selection:
Choose and grow varieties resistant to spotted stem borer.
Interplant with lablab, cowpea, or pigeon pea (Sorghum: Lablab 4:1) to reduce stem borer damage.
Biological Control Measures:
Egg Parasitoids:
Use Trichogramma chilonis at a rate of 30,000/acre/week for biological control.
